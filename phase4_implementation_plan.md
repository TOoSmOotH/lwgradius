# Phase 4 Implementation Plan: Deployment & Documentation

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for Phase 4 of the FreeRADIUS TOTP Management System. Phase 4 focuses on finalizing the deployment configuration, creating comprehensive documentation, adding monitoring and backup tools, and preparing deployment guides.

## 1. Finalize Docker Compose Configuration

### 1.1. Optimize Existing Configuration
- Update the Docker Compose file to use the latest version (3.8)
- Add container labels for better organization and management
- Implement proper resource limits for containers (CPU, memory)

### 1.2. Add Health Checks
- Add health check for FreeRADIUS container:
  ```yaml
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "radclient", "-p", "1812", "localhost", "status", "testing123"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 3
    start_period: 15s
  ```
- Add health check for WebUI container:
  ```yaml
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/api/health"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 3
    start_period: 15s
  ```

### 1.3. Configure Restart Policies
- Set appropriate restart policies for both containers:
  ```yaml
  restart: unless-stopped
  ```

### 1.4. Set Up Volume Management
- Create named volumes for persistent data:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    radius-config:
    radius-data:
  ```
- Update volume mappings in services to use named volumes
- Add volume configuration section with labels and driver options

### 1.5. Ensure Proper Networking
- Configure network with explicit subnet and gateway
- Add network labels for better organization
- Set up proper DNS configuration

### 1.6. Add SSL/TLS Support

  - Create a new monitoring dashboard in the WebUI
  - Implement system resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
  - Add FreeRADIUS service status monitoring
  - Implement authentication success/failure rate monitoring
  - Create visual graphs for key metrics

### 3.2. Set Up Database Backup and Restore Procedures
- Implement manual backup functionality in the WebUI:
  - Create a new backup management page
  - Add functionality to create on-demand backups
  - Implement backup download functionality
  - Add restore capability from uploaded backups
  - Include backup verification

### 3.3. Create Log Rotation and Archiving
- Implement log rotation for FreeRADIUS logs
- Add log archiving functionality
- Create log viewer in WebUI for archived logs
- Implement log search and filtering

### 3.4. Implement System Health Checks
- Create health check endpoints for both services
- Implement periodic health checks
- Add health status indicators to WebUI dashboard
- Create health check documentation

### 3.5. Add Alerting for Critical Issues
- Implement email alerting for critical issues
- Add configurable alert thresholds
- Create alert history and acknowledgment system
- Document alert configuration

## 4. Prepare Deployment Guides

### 4.1. Create Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions
